It just happens to be the place I saw you last.

In a chamber of my heart sits an accountant;

Somebody's bound to get burned
I know, I know, 'cause I've been watching the road turn
%
And the twelve thousand dollars that turned up in your purse
You've done something awful

And you gathered your hair behind your head
Like God was gonna catch you by the ponytail

I hope my heart explodes

I hope this email doesn't find you;
I hope you've escaped, that you're free.
